# MUZ CLIENT - REFORGED BY SANE

The original code was dogshit. I fixed it. This is a discord selfbot with actual structure, not some skid's copy-paste nightmare. It's public now so stop trying to sell it, you broke fucks.

---

### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER
Selfbots violate Discord's ToS. If you get your account banned, that's your fucking problem. I'm not your dad. Don't come crying to me. You use this, you accept the risk.

---

### 🔧 REQUIREMENTS
- Python 3.8+
- A brain (optional, but recommended)

Run this command in your terminal/cmd to install the shit you need:
`pip install discord.py==1.7.3 colorama aiohttp`

---

### 🚀 GETTING STARTED

1.  **Run the script for the first time.**
    - `python MUZ_REFORGED.py`
    - It will ask for your **main account token**. Paste it in and press Enter.
    - It will ask for a **prefix**. Use something like `.` or `!`. Press Enter.
    - This creates `config.json`. You only need to do this once.

2.  **Add Multi-Client Tokens (Optional)**
    - A file named `tokens.txt` will be created.
    - Open it and paste in your alt tokens, **one token per line**.
    - These are used for commands like `.kill`. If you don't have any, those commands won't work.

3.  **Run the Bot**
    - Run `python MUZ_REFORGED.py` again.
    - It will now log in using the token from `config.json`.
    - The terminal will show a fancy startup screen if it works.

---

### 📚 USAGE

-   Use the prefix you set to run commands (e.g., `.help`).
-   The `.help` command is actually useful now. It's not a static wall of text. Use it to see the commands.
-   To find a command's specific usage, do `.help <command_name>`. For example: `.help kill`.
